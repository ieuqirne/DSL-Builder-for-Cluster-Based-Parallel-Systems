 * The script used to create a node process network containing an emit and collector processes.

 * There will be a version of this script for each node
 * There will be no code loading over network in this solution
 * due to problems with Java Groovy and class loaders resulting from
 * changes in both Java and groovy as we move from Java 8 and Groovy 2 to 3
